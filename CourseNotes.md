#Chapter1
- Instead of telling computer the exact steps to solve a problem, show examples of the problems to solve and let it figure out itself.
- universal approximation theorem - can solve problem with right set of weights
- Limitation of weighted approach:
    - without data we cannot create models
    - labeled data is limited
    - predictive positive loop - more the model is used, more the data will become biased (based on environment) polocing as an example.

- overfit & properfit
    -  Model accuracy is getting worse - we are overfitting
